# IMMEDIATE FIX - Stop the Excessive Calls

## Current Problem
Your app is making hundreds of calls to `getBlockedUsers()` because the database permissions aren't set up correctly.

## Quick Fix (2 steps):

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Click **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `FIX_EXISTING_POLICIES.sql`
4. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Enable Blocking Service
After running the SQL script, add this line to your app startup (like in `_layout.tsx` or wherever you initialize your app):

```typescript
import { enableBlockingService } from '@/lib/blockingService';

// Add this line after your app initializes
enableBlockingService();
```

## What I've Fixed in the Code:

âœ… **Disabled blocking service by default** - No more calls until you enable it
âœ… **Increased cache duration** - From 5 minutes to 10 minutes
âœ… **Increased debounce delay** - From 1 second to 5 seconds
âœ… **Added fetch protection** - Prevents multiple simultaneous calls
âœ… **Removed excessive logging** - No more "Debouncing" spam

## After Running the SQL Script:

1. **Restart your app** (press `r` in terminal)
2. **Add the enableBlockingService() call** to your app
3. **The errors should be completely gone**

## If You Want to Test Blocking Now:

Add this to your app startup:
```typescript
import { enableBlockingService } from '@/lib/blockingService';

// Enable after a few seconds to test
setTimeout(() => {
    enableBlockingService();
}, 3000);
```

This will stop all the excessive calls immediately! ðŸŽ‰
